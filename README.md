## Description

The Australian Access Federation allows a service provider to trust the information it receives from another participating institution. This provides seamless access to resources and secure communication by removing most of the roadblocks to collaboration and sharing at both the institutional and end user levels.

The core of the AAF is a SAML based federation using Shibboleth IdP and SP installations. However in
certain situations this is seen as to heavy of a solution. Hence **AAF Rapid Connect** was created with the following benefits:

* There is no need to install a Shibboleth SP on your webserver;
* It natively integrates into commonly used development languages;
* PaaS solutions like Heroku, Google App Engine and Pagoda become suitable deployment targets for AAF services;
* Attributes are already defined in logical sets, there is no approval process for attributes; and
* Integration code is minimal, simple to write and easy to test.

This plugin further eases usage of Rapid Connect by integrating it with Wordpress meaning no development work is required on the part of the Wordpress administrator. Simply install the plugin and follow a few quick instructions to get your Wordpress site fully integrated to the AAF.
